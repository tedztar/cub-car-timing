# cub-car-timing
This is a working progress for a six lane cub (Cubs is a part of the scouting movement) car track timing computer. Ment to run on any Raspberry Pi.

If you can please contribute it will make the final product get here sooner.

What we want to do is make a program to run on a raspberry pi that will time a cub car race. The program will need to store information about each racer, including car number, first and last name, the group they are with and the times for the races.

Each car needs to run once on each lane, and the fastest cars need to run together also. The program also needs to tell the user what car to put in what lane in what heat for each set of races.

Thank you for helping with this project.
